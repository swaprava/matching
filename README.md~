# Gale - Shapley Matching

The purpose of this cgi script is to write a Gale Shapley deferred acceptance algorithm in Python and make it available online in the script form so that one can use the output of the algorithm even being opaque to the code that runs in the backend.

# Example

A running version of the code is <a href="http://matching-gs.host-ed.me/cgi-bin/advisor_matching_cgi.py">here</a>.
